This is crucial for being able to assess the quality of any individualâs support work.\n\n* Experience with WordPress, either as a developer, technical support / support manager, or website administrator. The level of support that we provide can get quite technical - troubleshooting live customer websites, using dev tools & error logs to debug issues, offering custom hooks, custom CSS, etc. - and although a technical WordPress background is not essential for the management of the team, it would certainly be beneficial. \n\n* Excellent soft skills; being able to communicate with team members in a constructive way that is mindful of their well-being. Even difficult conversations relating to performance issues should be approached with the utmost respect for the individual.\n\n* Meticulous attention to detail; being able to delve into any support interaction that may have been escalated to see where we might have gone wrong and how it could have been improved.\n\n* A passion for helping others develop new skills. We have a strong focus on the professional development of our team members; we want to give individuals every opportunity to learn and improve skills.\n\n**Bonus points:**\n\n* Previous experience as head of a large technical support team in a WordPress environment.\n\n* Involved in the WordPress community (attends meetups, contributes to WordPress in some way).\n\n* Background in WordPress development (in combination with management experience).\n\n**Benefits:**\n\n* Fully remote position - work from anywhere!\n\n* A company culture that focuses on the well-being of its team members - good work-life balance, flexible schedule, respectful work environment.\n\n* This is a unique position at an exciting time of growth for the company.

      "description":"Contract: Full time \nCompensation: based on profile\n \n## About us\nWisepopsâ mission is to help brands connect with their audience better. Weâre building tools that serve a more vibrant, engaging and personalized commerce experience for everyone. We have two products: Wisepops and Wisp.\nOur first product, Wisepops, helps marketers design and publish beautiful and contextual popups and bars. Wisepops is used by 1,300+ organizations around the world, including Unilever, Greenpeace, Virgin, and Postmates. Wisp helps brands build relationships with their visitors leveraging the power of on site notifications. Started in 2020, it already counts 100 ecommerce client companies.\nThe company was founded in 2013 by Ben. We bootstrapped the company from $0 to $1M annual revenue in five years and doubled two years later. No VC involved.\nWe are a team of 10 who joined from Amazon, Shopify, and Revolut and we were fully remote before it was cool.\n\n## Responsibilities\nAs Brand/Visual Designer you will be in charge of the visual appearance for both Wisepops and Wisp marketing & communication materials.\nYouâll work closely with members of the Product Design, Growth, Marketing, and Sales teams.\n\n#### Hereâs your scope:\n* Redefine and expand the existing visual language for both products\n* Create digital assets such as landing pages, cover images, and ads\n* Ensure brand consistency across all channels\n\n## Your profile\n* Seeking wisdom. You either grow or wither\n* Obsessed with aesthetics\n* Results driven. You know how to tell if your work is effective\n* Interested in Marketing and Business side of a design\n\n#### Requirements:\n* At least one strong example of your visual skills proven by a live example\n* Good understanding of the visual and marketing trends\n* Excellent use of layout, color, font, and image\n* Basic animation skills (nice to have)\n* Fluent in English\n\n## Working culture\nWe have been very intentional about creating our own work culture. Having no investors and being funded 100% by our customers help keep our focus on what matters.\n\nWe donât have a foosball table or free sushi in our office. We donât even have an office ð. We donât think happiness at work is just about fun perks like a teambuilding event in Barcelona (pronounced âBarthelonaâ to sound cool).\n\nMany of us came from Big Tech companies (Amazon, Facebook, Revolut to name a few) and got tired of large structures, top-to-bottom decisions, micromanagers, and BS week-over-week analysis. \n\nWe think happiness at work comes from human relationships, growth opportunities, and mindset.\n\n## What does working at Wisepops look like?\n\n#### Think of it as a team\nIn a team, there is no manager to tell you what to do. Everyone is bringing some expertise, knowledge, and skills that are unique. Then, it is up to the team to learn how to play and win together. No one has the final word because of their tenure, title, or seniority.\n\n#### made of super stars\nBecause we have no managers, we need autonomous people who know what to do or know how to find the answer when they donât. We expect each team member to be a leader in their field and we trust them.\n\n#### who work when and where they want\nWe are grown ups and trust each other. We donât need someone to tell us when and where to work. Each person at Wisepops is empowered to find their best work-life balance and work environment. Yes, we were fully remote before it was cool.\n\n#### to build something big\nWe have gathered truly impressive people to achieve very ambitious goals. Weâre not here to build a successful startup. Weâre here to build an amazing company. We think the key is to be 100% focused on our customers. We exist because of them.\n\n#### while enjoying the ride\nWeâre humans and we want to have fun with the people we work with. Life is too short to get bored or play the political game. \n",

      "description":"**Remote Full Stack Developer for Likvido (C#/.NET 5/VueJS/Kubernetes/Azure)**\n\nHello there! Are you ready for a really ambitious position as a full stack .NET developer?\n\nAnd yes, the role is fully remote so you can do your job wherever you want; from the beach, the pyramids, even from the moon if you like (well, of course you need to have an internet connection).\n\nLikvido is a (very) fast-growing startup. We are around 60 employees now, and we are aiming for a series A funding to realize our huuuuge ambitions for the coming years. \n\nWe are now looking for a skilled full stack .NET developer that can impact our products and become a part of our remote tech Likvido family.\n\n\n**Letâs be polite and introduce ourselves first - so who are we and what are we doing?**\n\nLet's face it: accounting sucks. Entering data into a stupid system? Sending invoices? Trying to get the last decimals to match so your auditor doesnât scream at you?\n\nWe would prefer spending time with family or friends. The same goes for our customers.\n\nAt Likvido we are automating accounting for our customers. We do this by having a super awesome product that helps you:\n* Send âsmart invoicesâ that reconcile themselves \n* Send automatic reminders for invoices that go unpaid\n* Pay your bills in Likvido so you donât have to go to your bank (and the bills of course reconcile themselves)\n* Automatically scan all your receipts and bills so you donât have to enter data again\n* Get paid if an invoice has not been paid on time through our debt collection system\n* If you really hate accounting, we also have an accountant service where our accountants take care of everything for a small price.\n\nSo to summarize what Likvido is doing:\n\nWe are letting you focus on what matters, instead of spending time on boring administrative work.\n\n\n**Tech stack**\nOur main application is a web application, where our customers can interact with the product. This web application consists of a VueJS frontend and an API - using the Backend For Frontend (BFF) approach. This means we are evolving the frontend and API in a symbiosis, where the API requests are tailored to the exact use-cases of the frontend. The styling of the frontend is a custommade look built with Sass and designed by our in-house UX/UI designer in cooperation with Studio Skulptur: https://www.studioskulptur.com/likvido. \n\nThe API is running on .NET 5 and written in C#, but we also have a legacy ASP.NET MVC application running on old .NET framework - which we are in the process of getting rid of.\n\nWe run all of our services in Microsoft Azure. The most recent services are running on AKS (Azure Kubernetes Services), and the legacy services are running on App Service. Our goal is to move everything to AKS. All of our source code is hosted on Github and we use Github Actions to deploy our services to AKS. We deploy to production at least once per day.\n\nWe use SQL Server and Azure Blobs for our data storage needs. We might introduce MongoDB or CosmosDB for specific use cases, as we are generally very open to adopting new technologies, whenever they provide some nice improvements over our current stack. \nOur general architecture is to build bounded contexts, with a number of services and databases inside each context. The services are small and scalable, and we use both queues, event grids and HTTP APIs for communicating between services.\n\nYou will join our current team, consisting of 9 developers, both frontend and full stack developers, plus a product team with UX/UI designers and product managers. We expect you to participate in the whole product workflow - from idea to production. You will help build new features, do code reviews, make releases, and make sure your features work and continue to work in production. You will also help us push forward our technical stack and infrastructure, to improve the performance, availability and scalability of our products.\n\n\n**Responsibilities**\n\nBeing a Full Stack Developer at Likvido, your job is to improve our product and build great technical solutions!\n\nDay-to-day that means:\n* Implement new features (C# + JavaScript)\n* Help maintain our current products\n* Actively participate in team meetings, discussing product feature improvements as well as technical issues and improvements\n* Make code-reviews and be responsible for the features you build\n* Help push forward our platform and codebase, to make sure it is easy to maintain and performs well\n\nYou will also participate in the development process like your other colleagues, which means maintaining the current codebase, adding new features, doing code reviews etc. We are moving towards forming small autonomous teams, with a very high level of ownership and influence over the product and the technologies. This environment provides a lot of freedom for the teams to take control over their work, and let their creativity unfold.\n\n\n**Requirements**\n\nWe are looking for someone who can say âYES!â to the following:\n* I am a senior full stack developer with a minimum of 3 years of experience in a similar position.\n* I put great pride in my work, and I like to solve challenging problems in ways that will make maintenance easy.\n* I enjoy following the technology trends and consider how they can be used to solve the problems we face.\n* I have strong opinions, but I understand and respect the opinions of others as well, and I will seek to resolve conflicts in a productive manner.\n* I have multiple years of experience with\nC#\nModern .NET stack (.Net Core, .NET 5)\nJavaScript (VueJS and TypeScript is a bonus)\nGit\nMSSQL\n\nSo without further ado: If you consider yourself a top full stack developer, and feel like having a very ambitious role is the next step in your career - APPLY!\n\n\n**Practicalities**\n* You will work 100% remote along with our existing team\n* We work within CET office hours but are flexible to accommodate other schedules\n* We pay a good salary\n* We expect you to be fluent in English\n* The position is full-time\n* You manager will be operating from Denmark\n\n\n**Location**\nð Worldwide\n",

We need someone who can not only build our existing codebase, but also push the envelope, as we are developing some sophisticated data science capabilities, similar to Netflix, Amazon, and Stitch Fix.\n\nFounded in 2014, Nadine West sends personalized outfits to our customersâ doorsteps every month. We are based in Austin TX, but we are a remote-first company, so you can live and work anywhere.\n\n**REQUIREMENTS**\n\nYou partner with stakeholders to understand the business needs and design right-sized solutions, able to move from open-minded design thinking to breaking problems down and iterating to create working software.\n\nYou have built, launched, extended, and maintained a business-critical Rails app long enough to learn from your decisions, and love sharing those stories.\n\nYou have time-tested beliefs about code quality, testing, architecture, database design, ORMs, and build vs. buy tradeoffs, and enjoy articulating those beliefs to your colleagues.\n\nYouâre at home owning the entire product development cycle (design, dev, testing, release, monitoring).\n\nYouâve managed CI/CD pipelines and love auto-deploying to production after your well-honed tests pass.\n\nYou cherish focused, low-interruption deep work like we do (See Basecampâs âIs Group Chat is Making you Sweat?â and Cal Newportâs âDeep Workâ).\n\nYouâre excited to work remotely, but also excited to share a US timezone and let us host you in Austin one day!\n\n**BENEFITS**\n\n* This position pays somewhere between your local pay and Austin pay (Google âAustin senior software engineer salaryâ.)\n* You can work and live anywhere that makes you happy.\n* We have always been a remote work company, collaborating across multiple continents. We believe you should be free to work whenever and wherever you choose.\n",

      "description":"After a heady year of going from 0 to 1 million users, we have secured funding from some of Silicon Valleyâs top investors to grow our engineering team to accelerate our growth to 10 million users. You will join a small team of 4 engineers (two others on front-end) dedicated to maintaining and growing our integrations (including Google Docs, Sheets, Slides, Classroom, Gmail) enabling voice messaging and feedback use cases for the education sector and beyond.\n\n\n## About Mote\n\nMote's mission is to make voice messaging faster and more useful for busy people everywhere. We help our users to type less, and talk more, so they can save time, communicate clearly and feel better connected.\n\n## The stack you will be working on\n\nThe current front-end stack is built with ReactJS, JavaScript, styled components, Tailwind CSS, increasing migration to TypeScript and a fairly usual suspect modern toolchain of Webpack, Jest, Playwright, yarn workspaces, Storybook, Github, CircleCI, CloudFront, Sentry and Datadog. We are working towards migrating parts of our codebase to TypeScript and we would really love your help!\n\nThe back-end is built with Python, Flask, Redis, Dynamo, ECS, S3 and sprinklings of Azure and GCP. A desire to contribute to back-end API implementation is welcomed if full stack feature ownership is strongly desired as a preferred way of working, but is very far from an essential requirement.\n\n## The role\n\nAs a full time front-end engineer typical duties will include:\n\n1. maintain and build new features powering our website and Chrome extension\n2. extending our layers of test automation (Jest, QA Wolf)\n3. review and feedback on Figma UX with our Designer\n4. contribute to coding standards and tooling\n5. write or review technical proposals on longer running work streams like refactoring the codebase, localisation, increasing test coverage, or packaging up our code into an SDK, porting our experience to React Native\n\nIf you like âfull-stackingâ features, and are willing, able or just curious to learn and contribute to our Python, that is a bonus though not an expectation.\n\n# How we work\n\n* We are a remote-only Product and Engineering team based in Europe. We believe some synchrony while we remain small is a startup superpower for being able to stay nimble and flexible. Therefore, team members are expected to be significantly reachable on Slack and Zoom over a 6 hour window between 9 AM to 3 PM GMT during weekdays.\n* We are not a huge fan of meetings, having all experienced megacorp meeting anti-patterns, but some high bandwidth communication is necessary for effective team collaboration. At a minimum, we have one weekly sprint retro and planning session, daily engineering stand ups and monthly company-wide town halls. Over and above that, we take a pragmatic, iterative view on the right communication tools and approaches for different types of collaboration, ranging from quick questions in Slack DMs, to tickets in Clubhouse, PRDs and tech specs in Google Docs, Figma design specs, ad hoc Zoom sessions to brainstorm problems, and planned Zoom sessions to review designs or specs.\n* Feedback is one of the core use cases of our product. We strongly believe a startup is an accelerated learning laboratory where the most important practise is to constantly and positively reflect on our behaviour and results, providing individual and collective feedback regularly.\n\n## Requirements\n* You are a senior front-end engineer, with at least 5 years experience at fast-growth consumer and/or SaaS tech companies.\n* Demonstrable command of working with production JavaScript/TypeScript codebases\n* You either have formal degree-level training in Computer Science or can demonstrate solid evidence of self-taught solid grasp of fundamentals.\n* You have demonstrated you are a high impact team contributor combining high levels of accuracy, rigour and output.\n* You have excellent judgement on engineering trade-offs, with a fine-tuned sense of when to pick between accruing more tech debt, leaving as is but increasing tests, refactoring or wholesale rewriting.\n* You live by the **âno assholeâ rule**, demonstrating high levels of empathy for peers, non-technical colleagues and users.\n\nWe are developing a proof of concept for mobile with React Native, so experience there is desirable but not essential.\n\n## Benefits\n* Competitive salary\n* Stock option plan\n* Leave package\n* Work from home\n* Flexible hours\n* Working with an amazing team",

Whether youâre [searching for a more meaningful job](https://blog.movingworlds.org/technology-and-social-justice-job-career-change-story/?utm_source=remotejobs&utm_medium=jobboards&utm_campaign=mwi-jul_jobboard_0621), interested in [starting your own social enterprise](https://blog.movingworlds.org/launching-a-more-fulfilling-social-impact-career-alumniupdate/?utm_source=remotejobs&utm_medium=jobboards&utm_campaign=mwi-jul_jobboard_0621), or currently at a [career crossroads](https://blog.movingworlds.org/growing-as-a-csr-leader-globalfellow/?utm_source=remotejobs&utm_medium=jobboards&utm_campaign=mwi-jul_jobboard_0621), the Global Fellowship program provides the **tools, hands-on experience, and network** needed to achieve your goals. The virtual programming is customizable for your unique goals and lifestyle, and is easily combined with a full-time job.\n\nThe 6-month program kicks off with a **virtual training weekend**, where youâll explore your personal and professional drivers, develop skills in design thinking and social entrepreneurship, and meet the other changemakers in your cohort. Youâll leave the weekend with new friends, insights, and an individualized action plan for using the next 6 months to accelerate your social good career.\n\nThroughout the Fellowship â designed to support you regardless of where you are located â youâll stay engaged with **weekly coaching calls, monthly webinars with industry leaders, and case-based learning projects**. With additional reading and reflection assignments, youâll be able to deepen your understanding of social impact frameworks like **human-centered design, behavioral economics, systems mapping**, and more. Unlike in a traditional curriculum-based program, youâll then gain hands-on experience applying what youâve learned to a **real social impact project** that builds on your strengths while challenging you to grow. At every step, youâll have the **support of coaches, mentors, and your peers** to help leverage your experience to reach your career goals. \n\nBy the end of the Fellowship, youâll have developed the **skills, network, and confidence** to take your career to the next level.

With our cohorts now virtual through 2021, weâre passing the savings of our in-person events on to you and reducing the $4,600 pre-COVID cost of tuition by $1,000. In these economically uncertain times, we know that the Institute is a big investment - we hope to make the Fellowship as accessible as possible through payment plans and would love to work with you if cost is a limiting factor. \n\n## Who we're looking for\nWe're looking for **early- to mid-career professionals from across all sectors** who are looking for the best way to contribute to building a better world.\nIf youâve ever thought **your career could be more meaningful and fulfilling**, and feel motivated to contribute to the greater good, weâd love to talk to you!\n",

      "description":"# Now Hiring: Remote Content Specialist\nA content specialist works to coordinate, produce, and edit content for Empire Flippers. Your goal is to increase lead nurturing at every single level of the marketing funnel using content.\n\nTo excel in this role you should be a strong communicator, writer, and storyteller. You have a sense of what is most compelling to an audience and understand what they might need to hear/read to walk away feeling like they got value from a piece of content. You should be able to deliver on the voice and quality standards of Empire Flippers content alone and in collaboration with our marketing team.\n\nSpeaking of collaboration â you should feel excited about really nesting into our marketing team. We work closely together to meet our quarterly and yearly goals and youâll regularly meet with the team to make sure youâre on track. But outside of a few regular meetings, for the most part, youâre independent and working on your own time to craft great content. The ability to be self-sufficient and thrive in an independent environment will be important.\n\nThis role is great for those who are curious and love to expand their knowledge. The online business industry is vast. Youâll cover everything from eCommerce, SaaS, private equity, affiliate marketing, SEO, to entrepreneurship, just to name a few. In this role, youâll become a powerhouse creator who can deliver content on just about every topic in online business.\n\nThe industry is growing at record speeds and it doesnât look like it will be slowing down anytime soon. This is the perfect time to get into space where you can make a real impact and be heard. Youâll also benefit from being in an industry that is vibrant and maturing with rapid speed.\n\nJump into the fast-moving current that is Empire Flippers and the online business industry as a whole and youâll go places, likely surprised by where you end up. Along the way, youâll have the opportunity to curate who you want to be as a content creator and marketer.\n\n## Our team\n\nEmpire Flippers has grown tremendously in the past few years and we are now a team of 80 people dispersed across the entire globe.\n\nThe marketing team is where youâll call home. We are a close-knit team of eight currently and are expanding to a team of 10-14 very soon. Currently, weâre located in Vietnam, Malaysia, South Korea, The Philippines, United Kingdom, Croatia, and Mexico. Though that location often changes, thanks to all that remote work freedom. ð\n\nWe work hard together, support each other, and have a good sense of humor. We want to see each other win because we know that creates a winning scenario for our customers and Empire Flippers as a whole. Our new hires will be an important part of our team and will be working closely with the entirety of our marketing team and will regularly connect with Empire Flippersâ other departments.\n\n## Background & Skills\n\nWe train you for every facet of the job and believe cultural fit is most important when we are hiring. So youâll learn everything on the job but you should come to the table with these qualities and skills.\n\nAffinity for writing. You either have a portfolio of published work or are actively learning about how to be a better writer. Maybe youâre passionate about writing and creating content and you naturally gravitate towards anything related to that sphere. Youâll be writing a lot in this role so being able to show an interest or foundation in writing will be helpful.\n\nA can-do attitude. You understand resilience and being able to power through obstacles that come your way. Youâre open to collaboration to get things done and you try to bring your best to everything you do.\nBe a good communicator. It sounds very clichÃ©, but youâll be brainstorming with team members in other departments, developing and collaborating on overall content strategy for both short-term and long-term goals, and creating new content ideas.\n\nA self-starter. We need to see some evidence that youâre able to get up every morning, bite the bullet and just get on with it, even if youâve tried four coffee shops and none have decent wifi. You wonât have eyes looking over your shoulder on a day-to-day basis, youâll be working in almost full autonomy, weâll need to trust you to deliver the goods. In a nutshell: you must be highly motivated, goal-driven, and coachable.\n\nYou need to have immaculate attention to detail. We need to hear you grunting and moaning if a word or grammatical structure doesnât quite look or feel right, as youâll be creating two pieces of in-depth written content per month to be published on the blog. Writing, editing, and proofreading are a large part of this role for all content being produced.\n\n## Preferred Skills\n\n- A deep understanding of crafting written, story-driven content marketing pieces\n- Strong emphasis on editing skills across various writing styles to ensure overall brand messaging remains top of mind\n- Basic to intermediate social media knowledge\n- Basic to intermediate SEO knowledge\n- Basic to intermediate email marketing automation knowledge\n- Basic to intermediate graphic design skills\n- Journalism background, Especially in Amazon FBA, DTC e-commerce or SaaS related\n\n## Duties\n\nRoutine Job Duties\n\n- Writing listing descriptions for new businesses going live on our marketplace\n- Outreach to off-site publications and websites with a goal of creating 1 in-depth industry-related blog post per month.\n- Optimize content with best SEO industry practices.\n- Publishing story and data-driven blog content twice a month.\n- Monitor mentions and backlinks across the web for potential content opportunities.\n- Manage and improve the ongoing editorial calendar.\n- Interviewing sellers for the RMRB podcast\n\nBig projects content specialists could collaborate on:\n\n- Content repurposing\n- Creating graphics for content\n- Data-driven content\n- Customized email marketing campaigns\n- Collaboration on large marketing campaigns i.e Season of the Seller\n\n## Details to Keep in Mind\n\nThis position is a fully remote role. During the first six-month period, your role will be probationary and your training and performance will be evaluated. You can expect to be earning a $2,000/month base rate. Following probation, you will join our lucrative bonus sharing plan. Should company performance hit 100% of on-target earnings, this role has a very good opportunity to earn between $50,000-$60,000 annually.\n\nWe also offer international healthcare coverage that you will receive once youâre out of the probationary period. We offer a stellar unlimited PTO (paid time off) policy as well.\n\nWeâre going to start you off slow. Youâll first learn about our company and what each department does; then you will be given some low-level tasks to ease you into the position. Over time, your skills will grow and youâll be making a lot of decisions on your own. However, you will always have our support and knowledge to lean on. We arenât going to throw you to the wolves â youâll be part of a high-functioning team that is here to help wherever we can.\n\n*US resident requirements: we will accept candidates residing in Texas, Florida, or Colorado, as we are registered for payroll in these states. Otherwise, US candidates should plan to live abroad or have plans to relocate to Texas, Florida, or Colorado.\n\nWe have a no side project policy: we do not allow any ownership, association, or affiliations with online businesses or websites. If you are the owner of an online business, then you will be expected to either sell the business before you join us or sunset it upon accepting a job offer from us. If you are not comfortable with this, please do not apply.\n\nA background check is required.\n\n",

      "description":"**About us**\n\nWisepopsâ mission is to help brands connect with their audience better. Weâre building tools that serve a more vibrant, engaging and personalized commerce experience for everyone. We have two products: Wisepops and Wisp.\nOur first product, Wisepops, helps marketers design and publish beautiful and contextual popups and bars. Wisepops is used by 1,300+ organizations around the world, including Unilever, Greenpeace, Virgin, and Postmates. Wisp helps brands build relationships with their visitors leveraging the power of on site notifications. Started in 2020, it already counts 100 ecommerce client companies.\n\nThe company was founded in 2013 by Ben. We bootstrapped the company from $0 to $1M annual revenue in five years and doubled two years later. No VC involved.\n\nWe are a team of 10 who joined from Amazon, Shopify, and Revolut and we were fully remote before it was cool.\n\n**Responsibilities**\n\nYou will be in charge of defining and implementing our content strategy, messaging and copywriting. \nYouâll work closely with members of the Product Design, Growth, Marketing, and Sales teams.\n\n**Hereâs your scope:**\n\n- Define content strategy and plan in order to 1/ educate and evangelize the market and generate leads 2/ educate and inspire our customers and 3/ increase Wisepops reach in SEO \n- Create high quality content to support our marketing goals: website copy, landing pages, newsletters, popups, notifications, guides, research, case studies, infographics, etc.\n- Plan and execute all communications and media actions on all channels, including online and social media\n- As we grow, assemble and manage a team of copywriters \n\n**Your profile**\n\n- Insist on the highest standards  \n- Obsessed with delighting right customers with great content\n- Results driven. You know how to tell if your work is effective\n- Brand awareness - a clear understanding of brands and the marketing mix\n \n**Requirements**\n\n- Proven track record in generating traffic and leads through content marketing in the B2B segment.\n- Experience in brand building\n- Experience in writing short- and long-form content like landing pages copy, blog posts, guides, eBooks, etc. \n- Fluency in English that enables you to write content for native-level audiences.\n\n**Working culture**\n\nWe have been very intentional about creating our own work culture. Having no investors and being funded 100% by our customers help keep our focus on what matters.\n\nWe donât have a foosball table or free sushi in our office. We donât even have an office ð. We donât think happiness at work is just about fun perks like a teambuilding event in Barcelona (pronounced âBarthelonaâ to sound cool).\n\nMany of us came from Big Tech companies (Amazon, Facebook, Revolut to name a few) and got tired of large structures, top-to-bottom decisions, micromanagers, and BS week-over-week analysis. \n\nWe think happiness at work comes from human relationships, growth opportunities, and mindset.\n\n**What does working at Wisepops look like?**\n\n**Think of it as a team**\n\nIn a team, there is no manager to tell you what to do. Everyone is bringing some expertise, knowledge, and skills that are unique. Then, it is up to the team to learn how to play and win together. No one has the final word because of their tenure, title, or seniority,\n\n**made of super stars**\n\nBecause we have no managers, we need autonomous people who know what to do or know how to find the answer when they donât. We expect each team member to be a leader in their field and we trust them.\n\n**who work when and where they want**\n\nWe are grown ups and trust each other. We donât need someone to tell us when and where to work. Each person at Wisepops is empowered to find their best work-life balance and work environment. Yes, we were fully remote before it was cool.\n\n**to build something big**\n\nWe have gathered truly impressive people to achieve very ambitious goals. Weâre not here to build a successful startup. Weâre here to build an amazing company. We think the key is to be 100% focused on our customers. We exist because of them.\n\n**while enjoying the ride.**\n\nWeâre humans and we want to have fun with the people we work with. Life is too short to get bored or play the political game. \n",
